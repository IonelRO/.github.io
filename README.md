## Build a Portfolio Site

### **Design**

#### Required Elements
The page at minimum includes all of the following:`
- at least 4 images
- title text (h1, h2, etc.)
- regular (paragraph) text
- a logo.

#### Semantic HTML
HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>` etc. are used to add meaning to the code.

No `<div>` or `<section>` tags are without a CSS class or id.

#### Custom Design
- Customize images and text.
- Customize placement of the elements on the page (grid layout) with `HTML`, `CSS` or both.
- Customize `CSS` styles applied at minimum to paragraph and heading elements.

#### Grid-Based Layout
- Page utilizes a grid-based layout with styles making use of the `flexbox` layout or a framework like `Bootstrap`, `Foundation`, etc.
- If you're using `Bootstrap`: the rows and columns of the grid must be wrapped in an element with a container class.

### Responsiveness

#### Cross-Device Compatibility
All content is responsive and displays on all display sizes. This includes:

- Desktop
- Mobile: Google Nexus 5
- Tablet: Apple iPad

An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.
